**ðŸš€ Overview:**

Welcome to the **Fashion MNIST Image Classifier** project! This app leverages Machine Learning and Flutter to classify fashion items like T-shirts, trousers, shoes, and dresses in real-time. The deep learning model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, and deployed on a mobile app using TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device predictions. ðŸ“²âœ¨
